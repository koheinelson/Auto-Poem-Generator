# Auto-Poem Generator

This program takes a user input and creates a poem built out of the text of a Mark Twain.

I came up with this idea originally when I was 16, and that version used JSoup to scrape text off of Rhymezone.com.

This new version uses data from Rhymezone's Datamuse API and comes with a GUI.
