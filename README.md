# Auto-Poem-Generator

This program generates a poem based on user input, using text sourced from the works of Mark Twain. Originally conceived when I was 16, my initial implementation utilized JSoup to scrape data directly from RhymeZone. The latest version has been redesigned to leverage RhymeZone's Datamuse API and now features a graphical user interface for an improved user experience.
